# embedpdf Extension For Quarto

This extension provides support for embedding PDF files into Quarto HTML files (including RevealJS presentations). Each file will be added to your HTML file using the `<object type="application/pdf">` tag with a fallback message and download link (in case the browser is unable to display it). Just specify the path of the PDF file; you can also optionally change the displayed width (in pixels or percent) and height (in pixels).

## Installing

```bash
quarto add jmgirard/embedpdf
```

This will install the extension under the `_extensions` subdirectory.
If you're using version control, you will want to check in this directory.

## Using

To embed a PDF file in your document, use the `{{< pdf URL >}}` shortcode. For example:

```
{{< pdf dummy.pdf >}}
{{< pdf dummy.pdf width=100% height=800 >}}
```
